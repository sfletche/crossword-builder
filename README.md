# Crossword Puzzle Starter Kit

Creates empty grid of any size with symmetric blanks, and numbered squares.

## Bugs
* Printable view no longer useful


## Next Steps
* Focus remains at end of answer after last letter is entered
* Clue height determined by input
* How to handle clicks on grid numbers that aren't highlighted?
  - highlight the answer on click...?
* Handle clicks on clue numbers that aren't yet highlighted
* What to do with clue when answer changes...?
* Export to json consumable by @jaredreisinger/react-crossword
  - https://jaredreisinger.github.io/react-crossword/
* Separate view for completed crosswords that can be filled out
* Persisting / Saving crosswords
  * New View / Route with list of saved puzzles (click to open in grid-builder)
	* UI for loading persisted crosswords
* Install Renovate
* Research github.pages.io -- https://pages.github.com/ -- (not sure about privacy with this option though)
* Publish / Deploy
