## Next Steps

* Clue height determined by input
* Export to json consumable by @jaredreisinger/react-crossword
* Separate view for completed crosswords that can be filled out
* Persisting / Saving crosswords
  * New View / Route with list of saved puzzles (click to open in grid-builder)
	* UI for loading persisted crosswords
* Install Greenkeeper or alternative
* Research github.pages.io -- https://pages.github.com/ -- (not sure about privacy with this option though)
* Publish / Deploy
* Option to disable blank square symmetry
* Option to fill in a word (a word that doesn't also create non-words)
* Option for completing the puzzle
